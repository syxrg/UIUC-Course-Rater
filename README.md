## About Our Project

### Problem Statement + Motivation
We want to create a more personal and student focused course explorer app with real student feedback. Oftentimes students can search for classes on course explorer, but it doesnâ€™t really give great insight on the course aside from basic course details and its course description. A lot of students have to rely on online forums or word of mouth to discover recommended courses by their peers or upperclassmen. 

### User problems that we are solving
* The current course explorer is not being tailored specifically for the student body 
* UIUC currently lacks a centralized place for student course feedback, there is a dependence on browsing forums like Reddit or word of mouth from friends
* Give students more insight on the course to better determine their desired schedule

### Other apps that are similar
* Course Explorer
* Rate My Professor

### How our app is different
Our app will be a more student-friendly and interactive version of Course Explorer. We will have similar functionalities but students will be able to rate courses they have taken in the past on a scale of 0 to 5 stars and leave comments/feedback about the class. In addition to course information, the average of all student ratings will be displayed when a user searches up a class they are interested in learning more about. Students will be able to use the ratings and browse comments to determine if they want to take a class or not, similar to how Rate My Professor works but for classes instead of professors. 


## How to connect to frontend & backend
A little how-to run frontend + backend to see our webstie!


In the project directory `/backend`, add a new file `.env` with the code below.

```
DB_HOST=34.172.119.90
DB_USER=root        
DB_PASSWORD=cs409yay 
DB_DATABASE=rate_courses
```
Then in terminal do:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```
Check Terminal for errors:

| Error Message | How to resolve |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Time out  | Add IP Address to GCP  |

If there are no errors it should display:
```
Connected to the database!
Server running on port 5001
```

In a new terminal:
```
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

If there are no errors it should open on `localhost:3000`
